# Titanic Survival Analysis – Power BI

This project uses the Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to identify trends and insights based on factors like passenger class, gender, age, fare, and port of embarkation.

## 📊 Features

- Bar charts comparing survival by gender and class  
- Pie and donut charts showing class and port distributions  
- Scatter plot of Age vs Fare colored by survival  
- Custom slicers to filter data by class, port, and survival status  
- Data cleaning and formatting for better visualization accuracy  

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Power BI  
- Titanic dataset (Kaggle)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes passenger information such as:
- `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`

## 🔍 Insights

This dashboard helps answer:
- Which group had higher survival rates?
- How did class or fare influence survival?
- What were the age and fare distributions among survivors?

## 📦 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop  
2. Explore the visuals and interact with slicers  
3. Modify or expand the visuals based on your goals
